        <h2 class="section-title">Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated History</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated traces its humble beginnings as the vision of nine college
                students on the campus of Howard University in 1908. It is the first Greek-lettered sorority established
                and incorporated by African American college women. The idea was conceived by Ethel Hedgeman Lyle who
                viewed the sorority "as an instrument for enriching the social and intellectual aspects of college life
                by providing mental stimulation through interaction with friends and associates." The small group of
                women who helped Lyle organize the Sorority was conscious of their privileged position as
                college-trained women of color, just one generation removed from slavery. They were resolute that their
                college experiences should be as meaningful and productive as possible. Alpha Kappa Alpha was founded to
                apply that determination.</p>
            <p>After incorporation in 1913, Alpha Kappa Alpha branched out and became the channel through which selected
                college women improved the social and economic conditions in their city, state, nation and the world. As
                the Sorority grew, it kept in balance two important themes: the importance of the individual and the
                strength as an organization of women of ability and courage. As the world became more complex, there was
                a need for associations which cut across racial, geographical, political, physical, and social barriers.
            </p>
            <p>Alpha Kappa Alphaâ€™s influence extends beyond campus quads and student interest. It has a legacy of
                service that deepens, rather than ends, with college graduation. The goals of its program activities
                center on significant issues in families, communities, government halls, and world assembly chambers.
                Its efforts constitute a priceless part of the global experience in the 21st century.</p>
            <p>Since its inception, the sisterhood has flourished into an international organization with over 360,000
                members in graduate and undergraduate chapters worldwide. The women of Alpha Kappa Alpha are dedicated
                to implementing programs of service that enhance the social, economic, and educational well-being of the
                communities we serve.</p>

                <p>A group of young women who realized that the greatest thing in the world is "Service" banded together
                    for the purpose of bringing about a greater interest in college training for Negro women. On April
                    9th, 1921, Mrs. Pauline Kigh Reed, Central and Western organizer of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority,
                    Incorporated, established this group as Omicron Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha at the University of
                    Cincinnati.</p>
                <p>The initial objective of the chapter was to give a scholarship to a girl that was graduating from the
                    city schools, with the highest standing, who wished to pursue a course at the University of
                    Cincinnati. Today, Omicron diligently follows the national program targets while incorporating them
