                the principles of service and sisterhood since 1908. The 2022-2026 administration theme, "Soaring to
                Greater Heights of Service and Sisterhood," aims to continue this legacy by mobilizing active members to
                lead in change, education, and advocacy. The Omicron Chapter actively supports these national
                initiatives through each of our programming and community service efforts. Look for these logos on our
                flyers to know which specific initiatives we are targeting!</p>
